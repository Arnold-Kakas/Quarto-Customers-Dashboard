# Quarto Dashboard: Customer Overview

This is my first attempt at creating a dashboard using Quarto and R. The dashboard showcases example random data, specifically focusing on customers in Slovakia and their associated sales representatives, regional splits, and types (internal, acquired, and prospect).

## Features

- **Dynamic Content Control**: The dashboard leverages the `kpiwidget` package to add interactivity, allowing users to control and filter content more effectively.
- **Custom Styling**: Custom HTML and CSS are applied to enhance the dashboard's visual presentation.
